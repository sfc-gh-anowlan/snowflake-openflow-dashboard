## Data Requirements

The implementation expects a view named `OPENFLOW_CREDIT_USAGE_VIEW` with 20 columns:

**Identification:**
- RUNTIME_KEY
- DATA_PLANE_TYPE

**Usage Metrics:**
- ACTIVE_DAYS
- DATA_PLANES_USED

**Credit Totals:**
- TOTAL_RUNTIME_CREDITS
- TOTAL_DATA_PLANE_CREDITS
- TOTAL_CREDITS

**Daily Statistics:**
- AVG_DAILY_CREDITS
- STDDEV_DAILY_CREDITS
- MIN_DAILY_CREDITS
- MAX_DAILY_CREDITS
- CREDITS_PER_ACTIVE_DAY

**Cost Breakdown:**
- RUNTIME_COST_PERCENTAGE
- DATA_PLANE_COST_PERCENTAGE

**Classification:**
- COST_MODEL
- USAGE_CATEGORY
- USAGE_PATTERN
- EFFICIENCY_RATING

**Timeline:**
- FIRST_USAGE_DATE
- LAST_USAGE_DATE

## Color Coding Scheme

**Efficiency Ratings:**
- 🟢 VERY_EFFICIENT: Light Green (#90EE90)
- 🟦 EFFICIENT: Teal (#98D8C8)
- 🟡 MODERATE: Beige (#FFE4B5)
- 🔴 INEFFICIENT: Pink (#FFB6C1)

## Next Steps for User

1. ✅ Review the changes made to `streamlit_app.py`
2. ⏳ Create or identify your credit usage data source
3. ⏳ Customize and run `create_credit_usage_view.sql`
4. ⏳ Grant appropriate permissions
5. ⏳ Redeploy the Streamlit app to Snowflake
6. ⏳ Test the Credit Usage page with your data

## Testing the Implementation

### With Sample Data
```sql
-- Create a test view with sample data
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW OPENFLOW_CREDIT_USAGE_VIEW AS
SELECT
    'runtime-' || SEQ4() AS RUNTIME_KEY,
    CASE WHEN UNIFORM(1, 3, RANDOM()) = 1 THEN 'SMALL'
         WHEN UNIFORM(1, 3, RANDOM()) = 2 THEN 'MEDIUM'
         ELSE 'LARGE' END AS DATA_PLANE_TYPE,
    UNIFORM(10, 90, RANDOM()) AS ACTIVE_DAYS,
    UNIFORM(1, 5, RANDOM()) AS DATA_PLANES_USED,
    UNIFORM(100, 1000, RANDOM()) AS TOTAL_RUNTIME_CREDITS,
    UNIFORM(50, 500, RANDOM()) AS TOTAL_DATA_PLANE_CREDITS,
    TOTAL_RUNTIME_CREDITS + TOTAL_DATA_PLANE_CREDITS AS TOTAL_CREDITS,
    TOTAL_CREDITS / ACTIVE_DAYS AS AVG_DAILY_CREDITS,
    UNIFORM(1, 20, RANDOM()) AS STDDEV_DAILY_CREDITS,
    UNIFORM(5, 50, RANDOM()) AS MIN_DAILY_CREDITS,
    UNIFORM(100, 200, RANDOM()) AS MAX_DAILY_CREDITS,
    AVG_DAILY_CREDITS AS CREDITS_PER_ACTIVE_DAY,
    (TOTAL_RUNTIME_CREDITS / TOTAL_CREDITS) * 100 AS RUNTIME_COST_PERCENTAGE,
    (TOTAL_DATA_PLANE_CREDITS / TOTAL_CREDITS) * 100 AS DATA_PLANE_COST_PERCENTAGE,
    'STANDARD' AS COST_MODEL,
    CASE WHEN TOTAL_CREDITS > 800 THEN 'HIGH_USAGE'
         WHEN TOTAL_CREDITS > 400 THEN 'MEDIUM_USAGE'
         ELSE 'LOW_USAGE' END AS USAGE_CATEGORY,
    CASE WHEN ACTIVE_DAYS > 60 THEN 'CONTINUOUS'
         WHEN ACTIVE_DAYS > 30 THEN 'FREQUENT'
         ELSE 'REGULAR' END AS USAGE_PATTERN,
    CASE WHEN CREDITS_PER_ACTIVE_DAY < 10 THEN 'VERY_EFFICIENT'
         WHEN CREDITS_PER_ACTIVE_DAY < 20 THEN 'EFFICIENT'
         WHEN CREDITS_PER_ACTIVE_DAY < 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
         ELSE 'INEFFICIENT' END AS EFFICIENCY_RATING,
    DATEADD('day', -ACTIVE_DAYS, CURRENT_DATE()) AS FIRST_USAGE_DATE,
    CURRENT_DATE() AS LAST_USAGE_DATE
FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 50));
```
